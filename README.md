# Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that I have worked on. Each project focuses on solving specific problems and applying various machine learning techniques.

# Overview
In this repository, you will find a variety of machine learning projects that cover different domains, datasets, and algorithms. Each project is contained within its own directory and includes the necessary code, data, and documentation.

# Projects
The repository currently includes the following machine learning projects:

[Project 1](https://github.com/oyerahul/ML-Projects/tree/8e8479af08587497c5da95052a0542e04bf84013/Project%201): The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.Let's begin our understanding of implementing [Linear regression] in Python for classification. 

[Project 2](https://github.com/oyerahul/ML-Projects/tree/8e8479af08587497c5da95052a0542e04bf84013/Project%202): For this project we will be working with the [Titanic Data Set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). 
This is a very famous data set and very often is a student's first step in machine learning! We'll be trying to predict a classification- survival or deceased.
Let's begin our understanding of implementing Logistic Regression in Python for classification.

[Project 3](https://github.com/oyerahul/ML-Projects/tree/8e8479af08587497c5da95052a0542e04bf84013/Project%203): In this project we will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

[Project 4](https://github.com/oyerahul/ML-Projects/tree/8e8479af08587497c5da95052a0542e04bf84013/Project%204): For this project we will be exploring publicly available data from [LendingClub.com](www.lendingclub.com). Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. We will try to create a model that will help predict this.

[Project 5](https://github.com/oyerahul/ML-Projects/tree/546c595f1831d1b2b1d7a9ff29114c58e4605157/Project%205): For this Project, we will be using the famous [Iris flower data set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

# Project Structure
Each project directory follows a similar structure:

1. README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, including its goals, dataset, and results.

2. notebooks/: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that walk through the project from data exploration to model evaluation.

3. data/: This directory contains the datasets used in the project. If the dataset is publicly available, there will be instructions on how to download it or a link to its source.

3. scripts/: This directory contains any additional scripts or utility functions used in the project.

4. models/: This directory contains the trained machine learning models.

# Usage
To explore a specific project, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in the project's README file. The README file will guide you through the project's objectives, setup, and execution.

Feel free to use the code and resources in this repository for your own learning and experimentation. However, please respect any licensing or usage restrictions associated with the datasets or external libraries used in the projects.
